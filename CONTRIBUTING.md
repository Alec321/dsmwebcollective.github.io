## Event Guidelines

- Events should be organized by date and then time.
- Use the event's location name for the `location`. Don't include address, city, state, etc...
- Only include the month (short textual representation) and day(s) for the `date`.
    - If the day is a single digit, include a leading `0`.
- Exclude the `time` value if it is a multiple day event.
- You only need to include the `group` if they have a user group.


## User Group Guidelines

- User groups should be organized alphabetically.


## Job Guidelines

- Jobs should be organized alphabetically by company and then job title.
